# How do I write code in Google Earth Engine?
Open the Earth Engine Code Editor here: code.earthengine.google.com. Navigate to the Scripts tab located on the far left of the Code Editor. 
Once you've received the confirmation email, open up the Code Editor in your browser.
If you access Earth Engine using a registered Cloud project, you may have to select it in the Code Editor user interface.
Select the function you want to run from the dropdown menu and then click the Run button to run it. 
This method is most useful for testing scripts as you write them to check if they work correctly or for running one-off scripts that are used infrequently.
